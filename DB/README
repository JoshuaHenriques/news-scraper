How to launch for dev purposes:
  docker compose up [--build]
    --build 
      Will rebuild the image and re-import the schema. This should only be done after "docker compose down --volumes"
        WARNING!!! This while wipe the data from the db

  docker compose down [--volumes]
    --volumes
      Brings down your volumes. This erases data but i required to re-import schema.
